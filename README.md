# Ranking Influencers on Social Collaboration Platforms


## Abstract
This paper draws an analogy between recommender systemsand social collaboration platforms and proposes a method to harnessinformation about users and items to model individual's impact in such collaboration networks.
With this analogy, we quantify social influence by measuring the latent influence of each user-item pair under a unified framework based on factorization machines. 
Experiments conducted on a GitHub dataset attest the effectiveness of the proposed framework in providing better rankings for top influencers than several baseline methods.
In addition, interesting analyses and discussions on the results are also provided in the paper.
