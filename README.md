# Ranking Influencers on Social Collaboration Platforms


## Abstract
This paper draws an analogy between recommender systemsand social collaboration platforms and proposes a method to harnessinformation about users and items to model individual's impact in suchcollaboration networks. With this analogy, we quantify social inuenceby measuring the latent inuence of each user-item pair under a uniedframework based on factorization machines. Experiments conducted ona GitHub dataset attest the eectiveness of the proposed frameworkin providing better rankings for top inuencers than several baselinemethods. In addition, interesting analyses and discussions on the resultsare also provided in the paper.
